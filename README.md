## My process

### Built with

- CSS
- JQuery

### What I learned

Useful refresher on JQuery for me. Design is not an exact match to the spec but its close enough. I think there must be a better way to implement the 'custom' radio button though, I ended up using javascript to pass though the number input focus event to 'click' the hidden radio button underneath. Is there a way to do this in pure CSS?
